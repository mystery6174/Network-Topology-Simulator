🔹 Technology Used: Python, Tkinter, NetworkX, Matplotlib
________________________________________
📖 Project Overview
The Network Topology Simulator is a GUI-based tool that allows users to visualize and design different types of network topologies, including Star, Bus, Ring, Mesh, and Tree. The tool provides a drag-and-drop-like experience where users can dynamically view different layouts and understand how devices are connected in a network.

📌 Features
1️⃣ Interactive GUI – A simple, user-friendly interface built with Tkinter
2️⃣ Multiple Topologies – Users can select and view Star, Bus, Ring, Mesh, or Tree networks
3️⃣ Automatic Layouts – Each topology is arranged realistically using NetworkX
4️⃣ Color-coded Nodes – Devices are distinguished by colors:
•	🔴 Routers (Red)
•	🟢 Switches (Green)
•	🔵 Computers (Blue)
5️⃣ Enhanced Edge Visibility – Connections are yellow & thick for better clarity
6️⃣ Real-time Graph Updates – Selecting a topology updates the network structure dynamically

🔍 Working Principle
The simulator creates network topologies using graphs, where:
✔️ Devices (Computers, Routers, Switches) → Represented as nodes
✔️ Connections (Cables, Links) → Represented as edges
Each topology follows a different graph structure:
•	Star Topology – A central router connects to all computers
•	Bus Topology – Devices are arranged in a line
•	Ring Topology – Devices form a closed loop
•	Mesh Topology – Devices are fully interconnected
•	Tree Topology – A hierarchical structure with a main server, branches, and clients

✔️ Network Planning – Useful for engineers designing real-world networks
✔️ Simulation & Research – Visualizing different topology behaviors

📌 Conclusion
The Network Topology Simulator is a simple yet powerful tool for understanding network structures in Data Communication & Computer Networks (DCN). It provides an interactive way to explore different network layouts without needing physical devices.
